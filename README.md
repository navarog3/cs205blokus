# cs205blokus
Final project for CS205, coding the game Blokus

Game.java requires additional end-state detection. PlayerTurn() and ComputerTurn() methods should be added as well. Current turn logic is confusing and buggy.

Instructions on how to use the software:
 - Download the 6 .java files from this repository (cs205blokus/blokus/src)
 - Running Blokus.java will begin program execution
